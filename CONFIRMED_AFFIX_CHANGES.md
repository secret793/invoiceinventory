# Confirmed Affix Report Enhancements

## Changes Made:

### 1. Added "Affixed By" Column
- **Model:** Added `affixed_by` field to `ConfirmedAffixLog` model

- **Relationship:** Added `affixedBy()` relationship to `ConfirmedAffixLog` model
- **Modal View:** Added "Affixed By" column to the report table

- **Export Class:** Enhanced to include sorting and allocation point filtering
- **Modal:** Updated to pass sorting parameters to export URL
